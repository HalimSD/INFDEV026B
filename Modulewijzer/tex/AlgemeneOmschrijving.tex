\section{General description}
	Databases are ubiquitous within the field of ICT. Many business needs are centered around the gathering, elaboration, etc. of large amounts of data. This data is crucially connected to real-world operations and thus its constant availability and timely elaboration is of unmissable importance. \\
		
		This course covers advanced aspects of data processing and elaboration within the different sets of tradeoffs of the precise but limiting ACID framework and the imprecise but forgiving BASE framework. \\

	\subsection{Relationship with other teaching units}
		This course builds upon the basic databases course.	\\
		
		Knowledge acquired through the databases course is also useful for some of the projects. A word of warning though: projects and development courses are largely independent, so some things that a student learns during the development courses are not used in the projects, some things that a student learns during the development courses are indeed used in the projects, but some things done in the projects are learned within the context of the project and not within the development courses.
