\section{Course program}
	The course is structured into seven lecture units. The seven lecture units take place during the seven weeks of the course, but are not necessarily in a one-to-one correspondance with the course weeks.

	\subsection{Lecture 0 - Refresher}
		The course starts with a quick refresher on SQL and RDBMS's:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Entities and relationships
				\item SQL operators
			\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Lecture 1 - Object Relational Mapping}
		The course starts with a quick refresher on SQL and RDBMS's:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Java database connectors JDBC
				\item Object relational mapping
				\item Java persistence API
				\item Sample implementation of ORM such as Hibernate or Eclipselink
			\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Lecture 2 - Indexes}
		The second lecture covers performance issues in (relational) queries and the potential to use indexes to speed-up execution of such queries:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Potentially slow query operators: \texttt{where}, \texttt{join}, etc.
				\item Sorting data by value: hash-tables and hashing algorithms
				\item Using a hash-index
				\item Sorting data by value comparison: balanced trees
				\item Using a tree-index
			\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Lecture 3 - ACID}
		The third lecture covers the inflexible but precise framework of modern ACID (R)DBMS's:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Transactions are integral: atomicity
				\item Database maintains valid state: consistency
				\item Transactions are serialized: isolation
				\item Database cannot break: durability
			\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Lecture 4 - Concurrency}
		The fourth lecture covers handling of potentially conflicting concurrent query execution in an ACID DBMS:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Serialization
				\item Locks
				\item Deadlocks and their prevention
			\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Lecture 5 - Crash recovery}
		The fifth lecture covers handling of disastrous events:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Log
				\item Write-ahead log
				\item Checkpointing
				\item Recovery from a system crash
			\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Lecture 6 - BASE}
		The sixth lecture covers an alternative tradeoff to ACID:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Stay always connected: Basic availability
				\item Acceptance of partially wrong states: Soft state
				\item Slower propagation of updated information: Eventual consistency
			\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Lecture 7 - Graph databases}
		The seventh lecture covers a specific example of no-SQL databases, specifically graph databases:

		\paragraph*{Topics}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Directed vs undirected graphs
				\item Adjacency list vs matrix
				\item Algorithms on graphs
				\item Case study: Neo4J
			\end{itemize}
