\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item The assignment must be submitted within 9/11/2015 at 23:59.
\item The assignment must be implemented using Neo4j.
\item Deliver the cypher queries into a \underline{text} file (not word!).
\item Deliver also the database folder of Neo4j (your \texttt{database\textunderscore name.graphdb}).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Assignment}
Consider the Entity-Relationship diagram in Figure \ref{fig:erd} representing the model for an airport database.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Give a graph database implementation in Neo4j. Fill in the database with data satisfying the following constraints:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item At least 6 airports, two of which must be name 'Schiphol', and 'Venezia Marco Polo', two must be located in 'London', and one in 'Rome'.
			\item The values of \texttt{size} in \texttt{airports} must be 'Small', 'Medium', or 'Large'.
			\item At least one airport must be 'Large'.
			\item Each airport must have at least 5 terminals.
			\item 'Venezia Marco Polo' must have a terminal 'B'.
			\item At least 5 companies, two of which must be 'Lufthansa' and 'KLM'.
			\item At least 5 flights, one of which must be scheduled before 15:00.
			\item At least 3 gates per terminal.
			\item The values for \texttt{state} in \texttt{gates} must be either 'Boarding' or 'Closed'.
			\item There must be a 'Boarding' gate for terminal 'B' in 'Venezia Marco Polo'.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Implement the following queries in cypher:
		\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
			\item Find the name and the capacity of all 'Large' airports.
			\item Find the total capacity of the airports in the same city. Output the name of the city and the total capacity.
			\item Find the name of the airport with the highest capacity. Output the name and the capacity.
			\item Find all the opened terminals in 'Schiphol'. Output the code.
			\item Find all the terminals of the airports in 'London'. Output the code.
			\item Find all the gates that are boarding in 'Venezia Marco Polo' for terminal 'B'. Print the number and the state.
			\item Find all the flights landing in 'Rome' for 'Lufthansa' and 'KLM'. Print the code and the plane.
			\item For each company find the amount of flights going to 'Rome' leaving before 15:00. Print the company name and the total of flights.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
